# VGG16-UNET-Pixel-Wise-Image-Segmentation
A deep learning project for semantic image segmentation using a UNet architecture with a VGG16 encoder. The model performs pixel-level classification via transpose convolutions and feature concatenation, preserving spatial resolution and enabling accurate object boundary localization using transfer learning.
